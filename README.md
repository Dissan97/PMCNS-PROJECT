#  Simulation of the Workflow of a Web App

Regardless of the paradigm adopted in modern web application architectures (e.g.,
webservices, microservices, serverless) software developers must describe the business
logic of the apps through workflows representing the sequence of execution of
the tasks. Depending on its layout, mapping a workflow to a queuing network model
may not be an easy task. More precisely, we refer to the case in which a request after
being executed by a station and flowed through the model, returns to that station and
requires service times and routing very different from the ones required previously.
The problem we face arises because JMT does not store the execution history of a
request in terms of paths followed between the various resources. To solve this, we
use the class identifier parameter Class ID associated with each running request to
track only its recent execution history.
In fact, each request in execution is assigned a Class ID that is used to describe
its behavior and characteristics, such as, type (open or closed), priority, mean and
distribution of service times. Routing algorithms are defined on a per-class basis.
Of fundamental importance to the problem approached is that a request may change
Class ID during its the execution flowing through a Class-Switch station or
when a specific routing algorithm is selected. Therefore, with the use of the Class ID
parameter we can know the last station visited by a request and the path followed.
To describe this technique we consider a simplified version of the e-commerce
application of an online food shopping company. The web services of the software platform 
are allocated on two powerful servers, referred to as Server A and
Server B,of the private cloud infrastructure. the figure below shows the layout of the
data center with the paths followed by the requests and the relative Classes. The
sequence of execution of the paths for each request coincides with the numbers of the Class IDs.

Server A is a multicore system that execute several services of Front-End.
Among them are:customer authentication,administrative and CRM processes,inter
action with the payment service (for the strong authentication for payments), check
out operations with the update of the DB, invoice generation, shipping and tracking
services, and update of customer data.Server B is a multiprocessors blade system,
highly scalable, fault-tolerant, with redundant configuration for continuous availability,
equipped with large RAM memory and SSDs storage for the DBs. Among the
most important services allocated are those for browsing the catalog, processing the
shopping cart, and managing the DBs of products and customers. To provide the
minimum Response time to customers, an in-memory DB is implemented to
dynamically cache each customerâ€™s most recent purchases.
A third server (Server P), located in the data center of an external provider, is
used for payment services.
To reduce the complexity of the description we have considered a simplified
version of the workflow of the e-commerce app, consisting only of the
services that are needed to describe the problem approached and its solution.
the figure below shows the services considered and the servers where are stored.
