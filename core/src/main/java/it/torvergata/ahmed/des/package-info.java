/**
 * Package containing implementations of a Discrete Event Simulator (DES) framework.
 * This package provides the base structure and implementations for discrete event
 * simulation, where the system state changes at discrete points in time based on events.
 * <p>
 * The package is designed to be extensible, allowing for different simulator implementations
 * to be added while maintaining a consistent interface and behavior. New simulator types
 * can be implemented by extending the base DiscreteEventSimulator class and providing
 * specific event handling and timing logic.
